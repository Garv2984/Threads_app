HOW THE COMMUNITIES WORKS
    1. now it is entirely the feauture of clerk i.e clerk organisations
    2. But that will be created in clerk, so we need to extract that data and putin our apps database
    3. And that is doable with WEBHOOKS ,
    

HOW WEBHOOKS WORKS
A webhook is a way for one application to send real-time data to another application when a specific event happens. Itâ€™s like a reverse API callâ€”instead of your app polling or asking for data, the other service pushes it to your app automatically.

ðŸ”§ How It Works:
You register a URL (your webhook endpoint) with the service (like GitHub, Stripe, or Clerk).

When an event occurs, the service sends an HTTP POST request to your URL with the relevant data (usually in JSON format).

 Example:
Youâ€™re building a payment system using Stripe:

You set up a webhook to https://yourdomain.com/webhook.

When a payment is successful, Stripe sends a POST request to that URL with payment details.

Your server receives the data and updates the userâ€™s order status.


SO WE SETUP A webhooks folder in api folder and set it up
